# Unhandled Promise Rejection in Express.js Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js applications using Express.js: improper error handling in asynchronous routes.  Unhandled promise rejections can lead to unexpected application behavior and crashes without clear indication to the user or developer.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling.

## Problem

The original code lacks robust error handling within the asynchronous `someAsyncOperation()` function. If an error occurs, the promise rejection isn't properly caught, leading to a silent failure. This can be especially challenging to debug in production environments.

## Solution

The solution enhances the error handling using a `try...catch` block within the asynchronous operation, followed by a more informative error response to the client. Comprehensive logging is crucial for identifying issues. More robust error handling will prevent unexpected crashes and improve the application's resilience.
